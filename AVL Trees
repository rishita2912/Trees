                             AVL Trees

Almost all the operations in a binary search tree are of order O(h)
where h is the height of the tree.

If we don't plan our tree properly this height can get as high as n where
n is the number of nides in a BST(skewed tree)

To guarentee an upper bound of O(log n) for all these operations we can
use balanced trees.

Height balanced binary search trees. Height difference between heights of left
and right subtrees fir every node is less than or equal to 1.

Balanced factor = Height of right subtree - Height of left subtree

Can be -1, 0 or 1 for a node to be balanced in a Binary Search Tree.

Can be -1, 0 or 1 for all nodes of an AVL tree.
