Trick to sind inorder, preorder and postorder traversal

Preorder Traversal :Draw line from left side

              - 7
               /\
           -  2 - 1       7 2 0 4 1 -> Preorder Traversal
             /\
          - 0  -4        

Postorder Traversal: Draw line from right side
  
                7-
               /\
              2- 1-        0 4  2 1 7 ->Postorder Traversal
              /\
             0- 4-

Inorder Traversal: 0 2 4 7 1
     
             
 Draw line towards downwards and then intersect


Binary Search Tree: It is a type of binary tree.

Properties:

1.All nodes of left subtree are lesser.
2.All nodes of the right subtree are greater.
3.Left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.
4.There are no duplicate nodes.
Inorder traversal of a BST gives an ascending sorted array.
