TRAVERSAL IN A BINARY TREE

Traversal means to visit each and every node.

Linear Data Structure : Front to rear
                        Rear to front

Non Linear Data Structure : Can have number of ways.

There are mainly three types of traversals in a binary tree

1. Preorder       2. Postorder      3. Inorder

Preorder traversal : Root-> Left subtree -> Right subtree

Postorder traversal : Left subtree-> Right Subtree -> Root

Inorder traversal : Left subtree-> root -> Right Subtree
